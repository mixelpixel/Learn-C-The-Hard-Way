Extra Credit
1. Open the ex1 file in your text editor and change or delete random parts.
   Try running it and see what happens.
2. Print out 5 more lines of text or something more complex than hello world.
3. Run man 3 puts and read about this function and many others.
4. For each line, write out the symbols you donâ€™t understand and see if you can
   guess what they mean. Write a little chart on paper with your guess so you
   can check it later to see if you got it right.
